<h1>Project Task: TMDb</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br>
<p>
TMDb is a web application that provides information about millions of movies and TV shows, as well as their cast and production details. The application's name is an acronym for The Movie Database.
</p>
<h2>Application Description</h2>
<br>
<p>✓ Users will be able to create an account, requiring an email, username, and password. During login, users will be prompted to enter either an email or username and a password.</p>
<p>✓ Some parts of the application will be accessible to users without logging in, e.g., they can search for movies, view movie ratings, but they won't be able to leave comments and ratings for movies. Without an account, they won't be able to create a list of movies they want to watch, for example.</p>
<p>✓ When creating a user account, users will be given the option to choose favorite genres, enabling them to receive notifications about them. If no genre is selected, all genres will be considered favorites. Later, it will be possible to change the list of favorite genres.</p>
<p>✓ Each user has their user profile. On the profile, users can have a picture and a short description, such as favorite genres, movies, etc. Everything on the profile can be either public or private.</p>
<p>✓ Logged-in users can see a suggested list of movies obtained from the selected genres from point 3 and from movies marked as already watched by the user (similar movies are selected).</p>
<p>✓ Users can rate a movie on a scale of 1 to 10.</p>
<p>✓ Users can also leave comments on movies.</p>
<p>✓ Users can like or dislike comments from other users.</p>
<p>✓ Comments will be ranked by most popular, newest, or oldest.</p>
<p>✓ There are several main lists in the application: the latest movies, the highest-rated movies of all time, movies by year, movies by genre, and the most popular movies (movies with the highest ratings and comments).</p>
<p>✓ Users can create lists of movies, e.g., "List of movies I want to watch" or "Best romantic movies." If users mark these lists as public, they will be displayed on their profile.</p>
